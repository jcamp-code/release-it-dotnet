# release-it-dotnet

## DotNet NuGet and Versioning plugin for Release It!

This plugin adds the following with [Release It!](https://github.com/release-it/release-it)

- Enables retrieving and setting the version from a .csproj file or Directory.Build.props file
- Automatic NuGet publishing
- Enables [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) integration automatically; no need to configure it separately

Both versioning and NuGet options can be enabled or disabled as needed.

### Installation

```
npm install -D release-it-dotnet
```

In [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) config:

```js
plugins: {
  'release-it-dotnet': {
    csprojFile: './src/Test.csproj'
  },
